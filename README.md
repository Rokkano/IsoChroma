# IsoChroma

The goal of this project is to mathematically determine the best text color to maintain visual consistency with a background color, compared to another foreground/background color pair. The use case: the hyperlinks in my résumé are sky blue on a white background, and parts of my résumé uses a dark blue background. Which color should be used for the hyperlinks on this dark blue section to maintain visual consistency ?
